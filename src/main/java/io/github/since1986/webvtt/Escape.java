        // To replace standalone ampersands ("&") while ensuring that entities like "&gt;", "&lt;", and "&amp;" are not affected, you can use lookaround assertions in the `replaceAll()` method. A negative lookbehind and a negative lookahead will ensure that the ampersand is not part of these entities.
        // This regular expression uses a negative lookbehind `(?<![&])` to assert that the ampersand is not preceded by another ampersand. The negative lookahead `(?!([a-zA-Z]+|#\\d+|#x[0-9a-fA-F]+);)` asserts that the ampersand is not followed by one or more letters or a number sign followed by one or more digits (which would form a numeric entity) or a number sign followed by 'x' and one or more hexadecimal characters, and then a semicolon â€“ these are typical structures of HTML entities.
        // Please test this method thoroughly to ensure it works as expected for your specific use case.
